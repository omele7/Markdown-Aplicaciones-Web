This project focuses on improving inventory management in the textile industry, where clothing, as a social and cultural expression, has gained greater relevance with the rise of social networks. Fashion and clothing companies, which produce in large quantities, depend on the care of their fabrics to remain competitive. However, many face losses due to the deterioration of their materials. The objective is to optimize inventory management, minimizing fabric deterioration and improving efficiency in the supply chain.
